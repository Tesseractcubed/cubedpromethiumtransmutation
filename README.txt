This mod is intended to be a patch for infinite resources of the few non-renewable resources in Factorio Space Age.
The mechanic used will be requiring the player to combine many components, with promethium, to duplicate a catalyst into
more raw resources. The reason I'm creating this is for very narrow ribbon worlds that have a non-negligible chance of running
out of the important non-renewables, effectively soft-locking the game past a certain point.

Specific resources duplicated:
Uranium ore from Depleted Nuclear Fuel Cells, fish, and Promethium
(single step process, except fish as a partially reused catalyst, in centrifuge)
Tungsten ore from tungsten plate, coal, lava, and promethium
(tungsten ore precipitation. Takes lots of time)
Scrap from petroleum, electrolyte, holmium ore, scrap, and Promethium 
(scrap marination in an EM plant; mostly a way to generate infinite scrap from promethium, power, and time, and 
maybe some materials from other planets)
Gleba... is Gleba. Except you make pentapod eggs 
Lithuim Brine from Foundation, Fluoroketone (Hot), Pentapod Eggs, and promethium 
(outputs lithium brine and Fluoroketone (cold), intentionally complicated.)


As you can see, the method is imprecice and intended to make you work for the infinite resources
It is my opinion that cross planet fliud logistics with barrels is a pain, so I won't force it.
All recipies will be locket to their respective planets.

Like above, this is more of an anti-softlock for a personal ribbonworld. The fact that these recipies exist, and 
are balanced for the high productivity situation of endgame resources and modules, means that they will not be practical
for the majority of players, but also shouldn't be an issue for other players, and maybe act as a gag.

Added techs: Promethium Transmutation, Uranium ore synthesis, Tungsten ore synthesis, scrap synthesis, lithium brine synthesis

Balancing
Most of the balance will take place with long processing times. As a mechanic, I despise this, but it is the most simple way
to prevent cheesing of the mechanics, by instead forcing very large infrastructure investments while leaving the landing pad
clear enough. Given there is a max cap for removing items from the pad, and even moreso in a ribbonworld, filling the 
landing pad with this process is too much for a typical player, in my opinion.

Pentapod eggs are a joke for the logistics required, and Gleba infrastructure required to efficiently transport these.
Also, we already work with biter eggs, why not pentapod eggs?
